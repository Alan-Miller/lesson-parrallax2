##step one
create an index.html and a main.css file.
##step two
link up your css file in your html
##step three
add some sections or divs and give them some background images from unsplash or anywhere you like.
 could be some properties like this

` background: url('https://hd.unsplash.com/photo-1470897655254-05feb2d2ab97');
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover; `

##step four

that's basically it. The property that gives us this effect is the `background-attachment: fixed`
cool huh.
